## App-Level Authentication (APP Client Validation)

All authentication endpoints require **app-level authentication** to verify requests originate from authorized mobile APP clients.

**Required Headers:**

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `X-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp (ms) | Current timestamp for replay protection |
| `X-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 hex | Signature: `HMAC-SHA256(app_secret, timestamp)` |

**Signature Generation:**

```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now().toString()
const payload = `${timestamp}`
const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', app_secret).update(payload).digest('hex')
```

## App-Level Authentication Errors

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `"Missing required headers"` | Missing X-Timestamp, X-Signature, or X-App-Type headers | Include all required headers in request |
| `"Invalid timestamp"` | Timestamp is outside 5-minute window or malformed | Use current timestamp in milliseconds |
| `"Invalid signature"` | HMAC-SHA256 signature doesn't match expected value | Verify payload and secret key for signature generation |
| `"Timestamp too old"` | Request timestamp is more than 5 minutes old | Use fresh timestamp for each request |
| `"Timestamp too far in future"` | Request timestamp is more than 5 minutes in future | Check system clock synchronization |

**Security Notes:**

- Timestamp must be within ±5 minutes of server time
- **app_secret** is both store at the client and the server
- Signatures prevent unauthorized access and replay attacks
- All authentication requests are validated before user authentication

## Error Reference

All API endpoints return standardized error responses with the following format:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Description of the error"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description | When It Occurs |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **200** | Success | Request completed successfully (data retrieval, updates, deletes) |
| **201** | Created | New resource created successfully (topics, replies, drafts) |
| **400** | Bad Request | Missing required parameters, invalid input format |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Invalid authentication, expired session, missing headers |
| **403** | Forbidden | Access denied (e.g., localhost-only endpoints) |
| **404** | Not Found | Endpoint doesn't exist |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Server-side error, database connection issues |

### Rate Limiting Errors

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `"Too many requests, please try again later"` | Exceeded rate limit (100 requests per 15 minutes) | Wait before making more requests |
| `"Too many login attempts, please try again later"` | Exceeded auth rate limit (5 attempts per 15 minutes) | Wait before attempting authentication |

### System Errors

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `"Endpoint not found"` | Invalid URL or HTTP method | Check API documentation for correct endpoint |
| `"Access denied. This endpoint is only accessible from localhost."` | Accessing localhost-only endpoint from external IP | Use localhost or 127.0.0.1 for health endpoints |

### Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Always check status field**: Use `status === "error"` to detect failures
2. **Log error messages**: Store error messages for debugging
3. **Implement retry logic**: For 5xx errors, retry with exponential backoff
4. **Handle rate limits**: Implement proper delays when receiving 429 responses
5. **Validate inputs**: Check required parameters before making requests
6. **Monitor timestamps**: Ensure system clocks are synchronized for auth
