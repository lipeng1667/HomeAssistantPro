You are my pair-programmer.  Obey the global USER rules **plus** these project-specific rules.

### Platform & tooling

1. **Swift 5.10** (Xcode 17), target **iOS 18.0** minimum.
2. UI must be **SwiftUI**; avoid UIKit unless impossible.
3. Concurrency: use **async/await** & structured concurrency; no Combine.
4. Use **Swift Package Manager** for deps; no CocoaPods.
5. Lint with **SwiftLint** (strict); auto-format with **swift-format** (`google` style).
6. Logging via `os.Logger` (Unified Logging); tag subsystem as `"com.homeassistant.ios"`.

### Architecture & patterns

7. Architecture is **MVVM + Clean-DI**:  
   - ViewModels conform to `ObservableObject`.  
   - Inject services with constructor injection or `@Environment(\.injection)`.
8. Networking with `URLSession` + `Codable`; never add `Alamofire`.
9. Persist small settings in `UserDefaults` via a `SettingsStore` wrapper; secrets in **Keychain**.
10. All new modules must ship **unit tests** (XCTest) and **UI snapshot tests** (SwiftSnapshotTesting).

### Security & privacy

11. Opt-in to **App Privacy Report**; annotate every network domain in `Info.plist`.
12. Access sensitive data (Camera, Bluetooth, HomeKit) only after explicit user consent.

### Design & theming

13. Follow **Human Interface Guidelines** colours, SF Symbols; dark-mode first.
14. Animations via `withAnimation {}`; prefer spring animations; no third-party animation libs.

### Workflow – Ultra-Think loop (inherits from USER rules)

15. **Ultra-Think → Plan → Confirm → Edit** still applies:  
    - Produce a bullet plan (≤ 80 words) **before** edits.  
    - Wait for `Proceed` signal.

### Output conventions

16. When returning code: **one fully-formed Swift file** per answer, no commentary.
17. Use placeholder API keys as `"<#API_KEY#>"`; never echo real secrets.

### Git & Comments

18. Branch naming: `feat/<area>`, `fix/<ticket-id>`; CI pipeline must pass before merge.
19. Include **fastlane** lanes for beta distribution; update the `CHANGELOG.md` in every PR.
20. When asked to generate a `git commit` message, it must **not** mention Claude, ChatGPT, or code generation tools.
21. Always commit **all modified files** except those ignored in `.gitignore`; never skip tracked or staged changes.
22. Each file must include a **header comment** with:
    - File purpose
    - Author (optional)
    - **Create date** and latest **modify date**
    - Detailed **modification log**
    - High-level **function list**
23. Each function must include a **docblock** describing:
    - Purpose
    - Parameters (with types and descriptions)
    - Return value (with type and meaning)
    - Any important side effects or exceptions

### Brevity

24. Unless the question demands depth, stay under 120 words.
